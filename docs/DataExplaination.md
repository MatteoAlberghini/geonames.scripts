# Data Explaination

Explaination on how data collection works and why we delete some data.

## Cities Files

We get all files from [Geonames data dump](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/).
The city files are store in XX.zip where XX is ISO code of the country.
From this file, we keep all point of interests where Feature Class has value P. [Link](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/featureCodes_en.txt)
